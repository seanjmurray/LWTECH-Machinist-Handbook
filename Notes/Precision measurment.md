# Precision Measurement

### Machinist scale

- generally 6 in
- good for quick measurements
- work setup: features free in chuck, cutting
- measuring tool stickout
- watch for:
  - parallax issues
  - edge burrs, rounded, and damaged scales
  - poor lighting

### Calipers

- universal precision measurements
- dial, vernier, digital
- outside measurement
  - use flats, rock back and forth on round stock
- inside measurement
  - top inverted hooks
  - use the points
  - keep flat
- depth measurement
  - bottom of scale usually has depth probe
  - keep perpendicular
  - usually have cutout

### Micrometers

- when storing keep some gap between anvil and spindle
- hold so that you can move both spindle and lock nut with one hand
- minimize handling of mic to keep accuracy (temperature)
